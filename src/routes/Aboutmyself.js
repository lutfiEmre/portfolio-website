                               Hello, I'm EmreLutfi and I'm 19 years old. I'm currently studying software engineering and consider myself a dedicated and skilled team player. My software development journey began with HTML and then I spent months improving my skills in CSS, waiting for JavaScript to challenge me like a piece of iron. After some time with JavaScript, I found myself drawn to the vast capabilities of React. I love learning new things and take pleasure in following foreign/Turkish documentation to expand my knowledge. In addition to software development, I'm also interested in UI/UX design and enjoy looking at website designs on a daily basis. Outside of work, my hobbies include creating 2D drawings using Aseprite.

                            I've always loved tinkering with things. I generally adapt to any environment and skill. Software represents my brain and design represents my imagination. I like to learn new things and meet people. Every person means new ideas, opens doors for me. Of course, the important thing is not to close those doors                </h2>

                            What we watch sometimes affects us, it is evident in our subconscious or in our thoughts. Movies and serials have always been a source of inspiration for me. I am influenced by what I watch
